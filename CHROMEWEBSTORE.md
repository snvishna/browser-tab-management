# Chrome Web Store Listing — TabFlow Agent

> Last Updated: 2026-10-04

## Store Listing

**Extension Name** [REQUIRED]
TabFlow Agent

**Short Description** [REQUIRED]
Automatically groups related tabs and aggressively prevents duplicate URLs to keep your browser organized using AI.

**Detailed Description** [REQUIRED]
TabFlow Agent is a background assistant that intelligently manages your browser tabs so you never feel overwhelmed. It automatically prevents you from opening duplicate links and smartly organizes your messy browser window into clean, topical groups. 

Simply browse the web as usual, and the extension will quietly detect if you navigate to a URL that you already have open, instantly refocusing you on the existing tab instead of creating clutter. When you need to find something, hit the keyboard shortcut to open the command palette, where your tabs are cleanly clustered into semantic groups using local or remote AI models. 

Your data privacy is fully respected. The extension uses robust local fallback mechanisms to group tabs locally if you prefer, or integrates with your own provided API keys for advanced remote processing.

If you encounter any issues, you can report them to our GitHub repository.

**Category** [REQUIRED]

## Permissions Justification

| Permission | Type | Justification |
|------------|------|---------------|
| `tabs` | permissions | Allows the extension to read the URL and title of all open tabs to detect duplicates and categorize them into semantic groups. |
| `tabGroups` | permissions | Enables the extension to physically move related tabs into color-coded browser tab groups for visual organization. |
| `storage` | permissions | Required to securely save your API configuration, settings, and local embeddings for the AI engines. |
| `webNavigation` | permissions | Allows the extension to intercept page navigation before it completes, enabling instant deduplication when you click a link you already have open. |
| `alarms` | permissions | Used for background scheduling, such as periodically cleaning up stale data or triggering scheduled tab maintenance without draining battery. |
| `scripting` | permissions | Needed to inject the command palette interface directly over your active web pages so you can access it without leaving your workflow. |
| `activeTab` | permissions | Provides temporary access to the current tab when you activate the extension, allowing it to take immediate actions like closing or refreshing the active view. |
| `sessions` | permissions | Enables the extension to read your recently closed tabs, ensuring duplicate detection can also restore recently lost work if needed. |
| `<all_urls>` | host_permissions | Essential for the extension to monitor navigations and inject the command palette interface across any webpage you visit. |

## Privacy Practices Justifications

When submitting to the Chrome Web Store, you will be prompted to provide justifications for the permissions requested in `manifest.json`. You can copy and paste the following responses exactly as written.

### Permission Justifications
- **activeTab**: "Required to inject the Command Palette overlay (iframe) into the current tab when the user triggers the keyboard shortcut or clicks the extension icon."
- **alarms**: "Used to periodically trigger background maintenance tasks, specifically checking for and archiving stale tabs that have exceeded the user-configured age threshold."
- **<all_urls> / host permission**: "Required to inject the Command Palette UI over any webpage the user is currently browsing, and to read the URLs and Titles of all open tabs for AI categorization."
- **scripting**: "Required to execute the content script (`content.js`) that mounts the Command Palette iframe onto the active webpage."
- **sessions**: "Required to reliably track tab history and restore tabs from the local IndexedDB archive without losing their session context."
- **storage**: "Used to persist user settings (like the AI provider choice, API keys, and auto-archive thresholds) and to store the local IndexedDB archive of closed tabs."
- **tabGroups**: "Required to physically move and group the user's open tabs in the browser window based on the AI's semantic classification."
- **tabs**: "Required to read the URLs, titles, and IDs of currently open tabs so they can be sent to the AI for categorization and grouping."
- **webNavigation**: "Used to detect when a user navigates to a new page so the extension can automatically categorize and move the new tab into its correct semantic group in real-time."

### Remote Code Use
- **Remote Code Justification**: "This extension does not execute arbitrary remote code. However, it does transmit tab URLs and titles to a remote AI API endpoint (Google Gemini or OpenAI) using the user's explicitly provided API key (Bring Your Own Key architecture). No data is collected by the publisher."

### Single Purpose Description
- **Single Purpose Description**: "TabFlow Agent is an intelligent tab manager that uses AI to automatically categorize, group, and archive open browser tabs."
